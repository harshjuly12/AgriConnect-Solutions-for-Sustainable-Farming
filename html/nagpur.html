	<h2><center>Land use</center></h2>
	  <p>The land use manifests the spatial distribution of land under different uses in 
agiven area. Eight categories of land use have been delineated in Nagpur district.
<br>1. Dense Forest – They are distributed mainly in Ramtek, Umrer, Bhivapur, 
Hingna and Narkhed tahsils. Teak is economically significant species in these 
forests.
<br>2. Sparse Forests – They are distributed in Katol, Umrer, Bhivapur, Mauda 
andParshivani tehsils of the district.
<br>3. Scrub Lands - These are distributed in Kuhi, Bhivapur, Hingna and Katol 
tehsils of the district and are associated with extended slopes of the hillocks 
and ridges.
<br>4. Barren Lands - These are significantly seen in Parseoni, Katol, Hingna, Kuhi 
andBhivapur tehsils and are mostly the rocky surfaces of the low hills and 
ridges.
<br>5. Ravine Lands - Usually associated with the streams and river courses, these 
lands aremore prominently developed along the banks of Kanhan and Wenna 
rivers and their tributaries.
<br>6. Fallow lands - Mostly associated with denuded mounds and are used for 
grazing
<br>7. Mines - Manganese and Coal mines are located in the hilly parts of Ramtek 
and Umrertehsils, respectively.
<br>8. Cultivated Lands - These are extensively spread over the gently sloping 
plateaus andplains, cultivated for different crops in the district.A comparison 
with previous land use records reveals that the forest area of Nagpur district 
has decreased due to excessive human interference and cultivation has 
extended to marginal lands<br><center><h2>Soil Use</center></h2>The prominent soils occurring in the district are, Black (65%), Red (13%), 
Loamy (18%) and very small percentage of Sandy and Red lateritic soils. Black soils 
dominate the area occurring particularly in Wardha river valley, which is most suited 
for cotton cultivation. Almost all soils are in the range of slightly acidic to slightly 
alkaline in nature.
The major soil texture is clayey encompassing almost 60 % of the area in the 
district where the clay content varies from 35 to 75 %. The remaining area of the 
district has soil texture ranging from clay loam to sandy clay loam.
<br>Agro-climatic Zones
Nagpur district is mainly divided into 2 Agro-climatic Zones based on soil 
types, rainfall, growing period and suitability for certain range of crops. 
<br>1. Central Vidarbha region
This includes Nagpur, Kamthi, Hingna, Saoner, Katol, Narkhed & 
Kalmeshwar tahsils of Nagpur district. Soils of these tahsils range from medium 
black, medium heavy to light. Medium black soils are found mainly in Nagpur, 
Kamthi, Hingna, Saoner & Kalmeshwar tahsils & are suitable for cotton crop. 
Medium to light soils are best suited for orange cultivation. Main crops grown in this 
region are Cotton, Jowar, Soybean, Tur, Mung, Urid and Paddy.
<br>II. Eastern Vidarbha region
This region includes Ramtek, Parshivni, Mouda, Umred, Bhiwapur & Kuhi 
tahsils of the district. Soils of this region are heavy to medium, average rainfall of this 
region is 1200 mm. Main crops grown in this region are Paddy, Jowar, Soybean, Tur, 
Mung, and Urid <p><h4><center>Soil Health</p></center></h4><br>The organic matter status of a soil or soil fertility refers to the status of a soil 
with respect to the amount and availability of elements necessary for plant growth. 
Plants obtain their basic food requirements from very simple substances contained in 
the soil and air.
<br>The clayey soils of Nagpur are comparatively rich in organic matter content 
than others having low clay content, other conditions being the same. Organic matter 
content in soils of Nagpur is usually less than 0.75 per cent. Using the standard 
classification scheme,outlined below in Table an organic matter status of Nagpur 
district has been prepared
<p><center><h2>soil fertility</center></p></h2><br>There is one Government soil testing laboratory located at district level through 
which soil samples are tested for NPK contents of the soil. On the basis of content of 
NPK soil fertility index for Talukas are made as follows

  <h2><center>Water Resources and Management</center></h2><p><br>
Well is an important source of irrigation and is found almost everywhere in 
the district. Irrigating nearly 48 per cent of the net irrigated area, it is a popular source 
especially where groundwater is plentiful and canals few.
Canals irrigate about 26 per cent of the net irrigated area and are mainly 
concentrated in Ramtek, Parshivani and Umrer tehsils of the district.
About 14 per cent of the net irrigated area is irrigated by tanks, mainly 
concentrated in the uneven and relatively rocky hills and plateau surfaces of Ramtek 
and Umrer tehsils where rainfall is moderately high and possibilities of water storage 
is also high along depression/lineament. This percentage is now increased.
<p><h2><center>Major crops</center></p></h2><br> Major crops and varieties cultivated are soybean, cotton, wheat, tur, gram, etc. 
The details of area under major crops and production are as follows:-Year 2012-13 to

<h2><center>Opportunities</center></h2><br>MIHAN project
Multimodal International Hub of Aircargo at Nagpur (MIHAN)provides an 
opportunity to develop hi-tech, high value, export quality crops, fishes, floriculture 
and horticulture crops.
<br>1 Urban Market awareness/Consumer awareness
Awareness of high paying urban market of Nagpur is necessary on thepart of 
farmers. They can take advantage of high demand for fresh and quality 
fruits,vegetables, flowers, food grains, floral and horticultural products etc.
<br>2 Possibility of area expansion under fruit crops like mango, santra
Most of the mango fruits (more than 90%) are coming in the city from states
like Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh etc. Thus considerable income is going outside.
There is possibility of area expansion under mango if sufficient irrigation is available
during initial growth stages of this crop.41
<br>3 Scope for fodder development- Area expansion
There is an urgent need and wide opportunity for comprehensive fodder
development programme in view of restrictions on grazing in the forest and at the
same time increasing demand for milk and dairy products. Looking to present 
cropping pattern, very little farm waste is available for cattles. Also area under 
jowarcrop is decreasing. Very little area is under maize which is preferable fodder 
crops.
<br>4 Dairy development-Milk and milk products are coming from outside.
With rapid urbanization in Nagpur district, there is an increasing demand for 
milk and dairy products. The present collection of milk from district isonly 12% of 
the total requirement.
<br>5 Animal husbandry.
Consumption of animal products e.g. eggs, beef, mutton etc is rapidly rising
throughout the country and the world. This has created increasing demand of animal
husbandry products. If international standards and hygienic practices are strictly
followed in preparation of meat/beef products, the products have anexport possibility.
<br>6 Organic food production
Due to increasing consumer awareness about residual toxicity ofagricultural 
chemicals like chemical fertilizers/insecticides/fungicides etc. the demand for
organically produced food (world over) is on the rise. This can earn considerable 
foreign exchange for the country with definite effect on farmers‟ income.
<br>7 Sericulture.
In order to provide supplementary income and employment to the village
people, there is need to promote sericulture, apiculture and fish in a co-coordinated 
manner
<br>8 Apiculture-Bee keeping
<br>9 Huge demand for soybean, tur, mung, udid, orange, mango, etc.
<br>10 Fish culture
<br>11 Scope for increasing productivity in each crop
<p><center><h2>Threats</p></center></h2><br><p>Natural calamities, long dry spells
Natural calamities can occur in the form of inadequate rainfall at the time of 
sowing and at fruit bearing stages while excessive rainfall leads to stagnated and
damaged crop growth. The remedy for these calamities is to have <br>(1) farm ponds 
providing protective irrigation<br>(2) well-planned drainage system to flush out excess 
water<br>(3) adequate and timely supply of organic & inorganic pesticides including 
theequipment's to be used for these purpose <br>(4) comprehensive and affordable crop 
insurance systems which should be compulsory and universal.
<br>1 Fluctuating market prices, glut situation
It has been observed that the supply of agricultural products is beyond the
control of farmers (both when there is bumper crop and there is crop failure).Under 
such situations, the prices of agricultural products such as food grains,cottonetc. in the 
market are more volatile than the prices of manufactured goods. The ultimate impact 
of price fluctuation is borne by the farmers who has no storage facility.
<br>2 No sufficient infrastructure available for storage and marketing 
Many of rural produce like milk, fish, fruits, vegetables may get good benefit 
with high value if properly stored and properly marketed. This would required a 
strong technological support
<br>3 Non-judicious use of natural resources
The increase in productivity of farms depends upon toning up of soils with
organic manures, providing optimum doses of moisture, etc. However, in this 
indifference/ignorance, the farmers neglect the most basic practices like 100 
composting of farm waste, need-based irrigation etc.Farmers having irrigation 
facilities tend to use more than proportionate water for irrigation leading to 
waterlogged conditions in the field, rise of fungal diseases which often lead to 
reduced yield. This also deteriorates soil health with long term effect.43
<br>4 Farm Credit is mostly used for personal purpose like for daughter's 
marriage etc. rather than for farming.
On the one hand, there is a need for increasing the capacity of farmers to repay 
loans; and on the other, to provide him loans both for agricultural and family 
purposes. There is a permanent need for government schemes of Community 
marriagesso that the loans taken for agricultural purpose will be used for the 
agricultural purpose.
<br>5 Poor post-harvest quality maintenance at farmer‟s field 
The farmers have low awareness about quality maintenance, hygienic 
packaging practices, grading etc. Cold storage facilities are not available in villages. 
<br>6 Lack of cooperative marketing and group approach among farmers
Lack of co-operative and group approach in production and marketing of 
agricultural /horticultural/fisheries products is resulting into exploitation of farmers, 
low returns and consequently low income. Special effort is needed to emphasize co-operative marketing of agricultural produce. This would help to achieve the target of 
4% growth rate. 
<br>7 Neglect of floriculture and horticulture marketing 
Although the district has good rainfall and good climate for floriculture and 
horticulture development, lack of “system and approach” to export marketing of these 
products is resulting in low development</p>

<p><center><h2>Machineries</p></center></h2><br><p>
Considering the labour problems in agriculture, farm mechanization is 
necessary.To a certain extent, farm mechanization helps in reducing the cost of 
production. Farm machineries such as tractor, power tillers, thresher & harvester and 
farm equipment such as tractor drawn implements, bullock drawn implements, selfpropelled implements apart from intercultural equipments have their own place in the 
district‟s agriculture. Presently, apart from tractor drawn and bullock drawn 
implements, there are 615 tractors, 35 power tillers and 48600 diesel pumps in the 
district.

<p><h2><center> Special Programmes and the Ongoing Projects in the District</h2></p></center>

<p><br>1 Extension Activities
Government of Maharashtra has initiated Mahapic Abhiyan since 2005-06, 
with a view to bring down the cost of production and to increase the level of average 
production in each crop. To facilitate this movement, various programmes are being 
implemented like Transfer of technology from Universities and Research Institutes to 
farmers field, farmers meets, exhibitions, demonstrations, exposure visits of farmers, 
Farmers Field School and Village Seed Production Programme. Monthly District 
Workshop and combined Field visits with scientists of university and extension 
officials of Agriculture Department are carried out & messages are sent out to farmers 
regularly. There is good rapport of agriculture & all-line departments with All India 
Radio & Doordarshan which gives good coverage to extension programmes.
Agriculture Extension Schemes:State Agriculture Department and Z.P. 
operating different schemes to increase productivity through introduction of modern 
technology in agriculture. Following centrally sponsored schemes are implemented in 
the Nagpur district.
<br>Integrated Cotton Development Programme: The components of the 
scheme are IPM, FLD, Pheromone traps, Farmers field school (FFS), training for 53
extension workers, distribution of bio- pesticides, demonstration of organic farming, 
CICR model and ITK models.
<br>Oilseed Development Programme: The components of this scheme are FLD, 
mulching, demonstration of ground nuts, bio-pesticide demonstrations, FFS, Farmers 
training, villageseed production programme.
Pulses Development Programme: The components of this scheme are FLD, 
FFS, bio-pesticides demonstration, HaNPV demonstrations, farmers training, and 
village seed production programme.
<br>Cereal Development Programme: The components of this scheme are FFS, 
farmer straining, crop demonstrations, exposure visit, publicity and propaganda.
Sugarcane Development Programme: The components of this scheme are 
planting material production, FFS, exposure visit, green-manuring.
Organic Farming Scheme: The components of this scheme are vermicompost unit,biodynamic farmers groups, certification and training.
Women participation in agriculture development: It is observed that the 
share of rural woman in all agricultural operations is substantial. To create awareness 
among rural women and help them participate in decision making in agriculture, 
centrally sponsored scheme is being implemented in the district since 2004-05. Under 
this scheme SHGs of 20 women are formed and agricultural extension activities are 
implemented through these groups. The scheme is implemented through NGOs in 
Nagpur district. At present the scheme is being implemented in 6 talukas.
<br>Maharashtra Water Sector Improvement Project:The World Bank assisted 
MWSIPproject is implemented in the district for a period of 5 years from 2006-07 to 
2010-11 Agriculture support service component of the project is mainly implemented 
byAgriculture Department. Following components are included under agriculture 
support service of the project.54
<br>1>>> Preparation of SREP through ATMA.
<br>2>>> Strengthening of agro-polyclinics.
<br>3>>> Strengthening of training institutes RAMETI & SAMETI.
<br>4>>> Dissemination of agriculture technology through training, 
<br>workshops,exhibition, exposurevisits, crop demonstrations, etc.
The project is being implemented in Ramtek, Parshiwani, Mauda & Kamthi 
tahsilsunder the command of Pench (major project) and Hingana tahsil of Kanholi 
project(medium project). Under this project, 59 Krishi Vigyan Mandals are identified 
throughwhich the technology will be disseminated, in the command area of the Pench 
and Kanholiproject
<p><h2><center>Allied crops</center></p></h2><br>Nagpur district is well-known as ORANGE CITY for its large orange growing 
tract and matchless flavor. The best quality fruits are mostly exported to gulf 
countries. This generates considerable income.<br>Apart from this, there is considerable chilli growing tract in the south-eastern 
part of Nagpur district and it is famous as BHIWAPURI MIRCHI. These crops are 
fetching better prices.<br>Almost all types of vegetable crops are grown in the district in the vicinity of 
20 km. around the city. Keeping in mind the per capita requirement of vegetables 
which is 150 gm., and growing nutritional awareness, the demand for vegetables is 
consistently increasingly. Vegetable crop is a seasonal and short duration crop, 
vegetable farming is an attractive occupation for small farmers and therefore, the area 
can be increased under it by cultivating vegetables intensively.
<br>Flowers are in ever-growing demand as the use of flowers is progressively 
increasing. And keeping the festivals and special functions such as marriages etc. in 
mind, farmers are inclined to grow flowers during specific season. The area under 
flowers such as Rose, Marigold and Tuberose is, therefore, increasing. There is great 
scope for growing flowers in off-season under controlled conditions.
