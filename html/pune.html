      <h2><center>Land use</center></h2>
	  <p>It was observed in the earlier chapter that Pune District has a geographical area of 15.62 
lakh hectares.The area under forest cover in Pune district is 11 percent, while fallow 
uncultivable land is 6.67 percent of geographical area. Land under non-agricultural uses 
accounts for 4.13 percent of geographical area. About 9 percent of geographical area is under 
cultivable waste, current fallows and other fallows. The net sown area is 63.49 percent of 
geographical area.<br><center><h2>Soil Use</center></h2>The trend in increasing the yield by adopting high yielding varieties has resulted in 
deficiency of nutrients in soils and is reflected as deficiency symptoms in plants. As we have 
seen in the earlier chapter, the soil fertility indices of PH, E.C., available organic carbon, 44
available phosphorus and available Potash, analyzed from 19946 total samples collected from 
different talukas of the district shows that about 73 percent of the soil in the district fall under 
category with neutral PH, followed by 24.4 percent soil of acidic nature and reaming is alkaline 
status. About 95 percent of soil in the district falls under category of low Electrical Conductivity 
and about 85 percent of soil contain low Organic Carbon. The available phosphorus and potash 
status in the soils of Pune district shows that more than 96 percent of soil in the district is low in 
phosphorus and most of the soil in the district is high potash (about 98 percent of soil). The 
available copper and manganese status show that the soils in the district is sufficient in copper 
and manganese. However, the available iron and zinc status reveals that about 92 per cent of the 
soils in the district are deficient in iron which need corrective measures for increased crop 
production and about 93 percent area of soils in the district have zinc deficiency. Zinc 
fertilisation is definitely required for sustained crop production. The micro nutrient status was 
tested in a sample of 797 soils. It was observed that while copper and manganese were 
sufficient, there was iron deficiency in 91 percent of samples and zinc deficiency in 93 percent 
of samples. The reclamation and development of saline/Alkali soils in Pune district is presented 
in Table 2. It can be observed from the table that 38087 hectares are under saline/Alkali soils 
and this area has not yet been treated.

<p>Source: District Soil Survey and Soil Testing Office, Pune</p><br>The number of Soil Testing Laboratories in Pune district is presented in Table 4.4. 
During the year 2011-12, there were 20 Soil testing laboratories with an annual analyzing 
capacity of 116750 samples. It can be observed that 4 laboratories are in Private sector while 
only one laboratory is in Government sector.
<p>Crops are grown in three seasons in the districts, i.e Kharif, Rabi, Summer. The cropping 
pattern of the Pune district is different from the state as well as most of the districts in the state. 
Rabbi is the predominant season, in which rabi jowar crop accounts major share in area. As we 47
have seen earlier, about 35.6 percent of gross cropped area is under rabi jowar, followed by 
bajara, which has about 10.3 percent share. The major crops and varieties grown in Pune district 
is presented in Table 4.</p>

<p>Table:-Major crops and varieties grown in Pune district</p>
<h2><center>Opportunities</center></h2><br>1.There is tremendous scope for the growth of Horticulture. Horticulture crops have a 
strong potential to raise returns to land, labour and capital and are pro- small farmers. In 
Pune district, the land holding pattern reveals that 80.5 percent of farmers have land 
holding below 2 hectares. Cultivation of horticultural crops therefore provides 
opportunity to them to raise their incomes.<br>2.The share of fruits and vegetables has been undergoing a major change in the food basket 
of the urban and rural consumer over the years. There is increase in demand for fruits 
and vegetables which provides an opportunity for Pune district to increase production of 
these crops.<br>3.Agro and food processing units have great scope in view of the wide variety of fruits and 
vegetables grown in this district. Due to urbanization, a ready market is available for 
consumption of such products. Food processing has also been deregulated in 1991 and 
foreign direct investment in food processing.Food processing has also been accorded priority status for borrowing from institutional 
credit agencies. The APMC act has been amended allowing private markets and direct 
transaction of food commodities between buyers and sellers.<br>4.A number of government schemes such as Employment Guarantee Scheme linked to 
Horticultural Development in Maharashtra, setting up of National Horticulture Mission 
provide opportunity to promote the horticultural sector.<br>5.There is also good scope for development of agro-tourism in and around Pune as well as 
Pune district as a whole. This will greatly help to enhance revenue of the district.
<h2><center>Threats</center></h2><br>1.There is also good scope for development of agro-tourism in and around Pune as well as 
Pune district as a whole. This will greatly help to enhance revenue of the district.<br>2.The demand for rural infrastructure facilities is ever increasing, which if not fulfilled 
may lead to more migration and fall in agricultural production.<br>3.With increase in production of horticultural products, lack of post harvest infrastructure 
and agro processing units may lead to huge post harvest losses. Thus if roads, markets, 40
communication, electricity and other such infrastructure are not developed, horticultural 
growth will come under pressure.<br>4.With increase in production of horticultural products, lack of post harvest infrastructure
